<h1>Gaurav Gupta</h1>
</div>
<p>I was born in a small town named Banswara in Rajasthan. I did my high schooling in Jaipur where I got enthusiasm for engineering and prepared for IIT-JEE. From my childhood, I had interest in creating things using spare parts. I always spent my time looking for needs of the people around me and tried to come up with a solution, howsoever small it may be. I believe that in addition to academic excellence, it is because of this tinkering that I chose engineering as my career.</p>
<p>I did my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from one of the best engineering institute in the country,<a href="http://iitk.ac.in"> Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur</a> in 2013. I joined <a href="http://uci.edu">University of California Irvine</a> for MS-PhD in Electrical Engineering in 2014.</p>
