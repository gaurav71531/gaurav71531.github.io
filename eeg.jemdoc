*Abstract:* Brain interfaces are cyber-physical systems that aim to harvest 
information from the (physical) brain through sensing mechanisms, extract information 
about the underlying processes, and decide\/actuate accordingly. Nonetheless, the brain 
interfaces are still in their infancy, but reaching to their maturity quickly as several 
initiatives are released to push forward their development (e.g., NeuraLink by Elon Musk 
and `typing-by-brain' by Facebook). This has motivated us to revisit the design of 
EEG-based non-invasive brain interfaces. Specifically, current methodologies entail a 
highly skilled neuro-functional approach and evidence-based \a priori\ knowledge 
about specific signal features and their interpretation from a neuro-physiological 
point of view. Hereafter, we propose to demystify such approaches, as we propose to 
leverage new time-varying complex network models that equip us with a fractal dynamical 
characterization of the underlying processes. Subsequently, the parameters of the 
proposed complex network models can be explained from a system's perspective, and, 
consecutively, used for classification using machine learning algorithms and\/or actuation
 laws determined using control system's theory. Besides, the proposed system 
 identification methods and techniques have computational complexities comparable with 
 those currently used in EEG-based brain interfaces, which enable comparable online 
 performances. Furthermore, we foresee that the proposed models and approaches are also 
 valid using other invasive and non-invasive technologies. Finally, we illustrate and 
 experimentally evaluate this approach on real EEG-datasets to assess and validate the 
 proposed methodology. The classification accuracies are high even on having less number 
 of training samples.\n
