<p>We welcome applications from passionate and talented PhD research assistants and postdoctoral scholars. We seek individuals from varied backgrounds, with interests in applied mathematics (e.g., fractals, fractional calculus, optimization, high dimensional statistics, modeling complex dynamics, machine learning, signal processing), statistical physics and its applications, complex networks / network science (biological, brain, social and technological networks), mathematical modeling and analysis of complex systems, computational and systems biology, theoretical approaches for biological swarms, neuroscience and cognitive behavior modeling, control theory with applications to complex systems and complex interdependency networks, cyber-physical systems, computer science and engineering.</p>
<p>Ongoing research projects supporting these positions are of interdisciplinary nature and focus on decoding the principles of cognition and autonomy in biological swarms and microbial communities, identification of time varying complex networks, modeling and control of time-varying complex interdependent networks, characterization of real complex interdependent networks (e.g., drug-drug interaction network) and their implications, time-dependent multi-fractal optimal control, mathematical modeling of physiological processes and their implications for designing robust biological inspired controllers for medical cyber-physical systems and other CPS areas (transportation, smart grid), efficient optimization algorithms for resource allocation problems under uncertainty. On more traditional electrical engineering and computer science side, our research projects include design methodologies of embedded networked systems, cyber-physical systems and Networks-on-Chip based manycore platforms. Again, interdisciplinarity is strongly enforced as many of these research problems require a deep understanding of theoretical concepts such as compilers, automata theory, models of computation, computation and communication complexity theory, optimization, and device physics / systems concepts such as technological networks, operating systems, system-level design, and VLSI. This work is sponsored by prestigious funding agencies such as DARPA and NSF. Of note, a strong emphasis on our research group is put on developing new mathematical modeling strategies and algorithms and less on applying existing tools to new problems. On many of the above research projects, we collaborate with outstanding researchers to verify the developed mathematical and algorithmic approaches on real datasets.</p>
<p>Inquiries should include a cover letter, comprehensive Curriculum Vitae and possibly 1-2 scholar manuscripts sent to Prof. Bogdan. Interested candidates should have excellent mathematical (analytical) skills, be eager to learn and discover new fields and potentially propose new theories, strive for excellent communication and interaction with researchers within and across other research communities, solid knowledge in programming (e.g., C/ C++/Java/Matlab) for software development and scientific computing for verifying the proposed theoretical approaches</p>
